# Autonomous SLAM with ROS using the DrRobot X80 and an Intel RealSense Camera
This repository is dedicated to the development of a robotic system that performs [Simultaneous Localization And Mapping](https://github.com/A01371852/RoboProject/projects/1) through ROS.
SLAM is concerned with the problem of building the map of an unknown environment with a mobile robot, while at the same time being able to localize itself within the navigated environment. The system is to be implemented with the DrRobot X80 platform as a starting point, as well as using an Intel Realsense RGB/Depth camera to retrieve visual information for the 3D mapping of closed room.
